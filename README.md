# xhub

A simple web service designed to persist metadata associated with experimental
studies.

**xhub** is currently being used to persist [uc-xromm](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/uc-xromm)-related study data.  It functions as a web service for the [`xpub`](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/xpub) client, storing/retrieving the JSON-encoded metadata sent/requested by the client.
